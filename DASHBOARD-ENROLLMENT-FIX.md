# Dashboard Enrollment State Fix

## Issue Summary

After successful course purchase, the dashboard continued to show pre-enrollment state (masterclass offer card) even though the PurchaseButton correctly recognized the user as enrolled and displayed "Irányítópult megnyitása" (Go to Dashboard).

## Root Cause

The payment success page (`app/payment/success/page.tsx`) was calling `refreshUser()` to update the AuthContext but **was not invalidating React Query caches**. This caused two different hooks to show different enrollment states:

1. **PurchaseButton** uses `useEnrollmentStatus` hook
   - Query key: `['enrollment', courseId, userId]`
   - Checks enrollment directly via API endpoint
   - **Correctly showed enrolled state** because it refreshes more frequently

2. **Dashboard** uses `useUserProgress` hook
   - Query key: `['userProgress', userId]`
   - Has 5-minute `staleTime` and 30-second `refetchInterval`
   - **Showed stale pre-enrollment state** because cache wasn't invalidated after payment

## The Fix

Modified `app/payment/success/page.tsx` to invalidate React Query caches immediately after successful payment:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN - only refreshed AuthContext)
if (status.courseAccess) {
  await refreshUser();
}

// After (FIXED - invalidates all enrollment caches)
if (status.courseAccess) {
  // Refresh user data to get updated course access
  await refreshUser();

  // Invalidate React Query caches to ensure dashboard shows correct enrollment state
  console.log('[Payment Success] Invalidating React Query caches for user:', user?.id);
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['userProgress'] });
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['enrollment'] });

  // Force refetch userProgress with current user ID
  if (user?.id) {
    await queryClient.refetchQueries({
      queryKey: ['userProgress', user.id],
      exact: true
    });
  }
  console.log('[Payment Success] Cache invalidation complete');
}
```

## Technical Changes

### File Modified: `app/payment/success/page.tsx`

**Lines Changed:**
- Line 8: Added `import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';`
- Line 14: Added `const queryClient = useQueryClient();`
- Lines 40-52: Added cache invalidation logic after `refreshUser()`
- Line 66: Updated useEffect dependencies to include `queryClient` and `user?.id`

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

1. **Broad Invalidation**: `invalidateQueries(['userProgress'])` and `invalidateQueries(['enrollment'])` mark all related queries as stale
2. **Immediate Refetch**: `refetchQueries(['userProgress', user.id], { exact: true })` forces immediate data refresh
3. **Logging**: Added console logs for debugging cache invalidation flow

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User completes payment on Stripe checkout page
2. Redirected to payment success page (`/payment/success?session_id=...`)
3. Payment verification runs:
   - Calls `paymentApi.getPaymentStatus(sessionId)`
   - Receives `{ success: true, status: 'completed', courseAccess: true }`
4. Cache invalidation executes:
   - `refreshUser()` updates AuthContext
   - `invalidateQueries` marks both enrollment caches as stale
   - `refetchQueries` immediately fetches fresh userProgress data
5. User navigates to dashboard
6. **Dashboard now shows enrolled state** with correct course access

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Complete a test purchase flow:
   - Go to course page
   - Click purchase button
   - Complete Stripe checkout
   - Land on success page
   - Click "Dashboard megtekintése"

2. Check dashboard state:
   - Should NOT show masterclass offer card
   - Should show enrolled courses section
   - Course should appear in "enrolledCourses" list

3. Check browser console:
   - Should see `[Payment Success] Invalidating React Query caches for user: [userId]`
   - Should see `[Payment Success] Cache invalidation complete`
   - Should see fresh enrollment data being fetched

## Related Files

### Frontend (Next.js)
- `app/payment/success/page.tsx` - **MODIFIED** (added cache invalidation)
- `hooks/useEnrollmentStatus.ts` - Uses `['enrollment', courseId, userId]` cache key
- `hooks/useUserProgress.ts` - Uses `['userProgress', userId]` cache key
- `components/course/PurchaseButton.tsx` - Uses `useEnrollmentStatus` hook
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Uses `useUserProgress` hook

### Backend (No changes needed)
- `app/api/users/[userId]/progress/route.ts` - Already correctly checks 4 enrollment sources
- `functions/src/routes/enrollments.ts` - Already correctly creates enrollment documents

## Architecture Insight

### Dual Hook System
The application has two parallel enrollment checking systems:

1. **Enrollment Status Hook** (`useEnrollmentStatus`)
   - Direct enrollment check via `/enrollments/check/:courseId`
   - Used by: PurchaseButton, Course pages
   - Fast, course-specific query

2. **User Progress Hook** (`useUserProgress`)
   - Comprehensive user data including all enrollments
   - Used by: Dashboard, Profile, Learning pages
   - Broader query with longer cache time

Both hooks need cache invalidation after enrollment changes to maintain consistency.

## Deployment

### Commit Information
- **Commit**: `458eb0f`
- **Message**: "Fix dashboard enrollment state with React Query cache invalidation"
- **Files Changed**: 1 file (app/payment/success/page.tsx)
- **Lines Added**: 18
- **Lines Removed**: 1

### Deployment Status
- ✅ Built successfully: `npm run build` completed without errors
- ✅ Committed to git: Changes committed with detailed message
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub: Pushed to `main` branch
- ✅ Vercel Deployment: Automatic deployment triggered via GitHub integration
- ✅ No backend changes needed: Firebase Functions remain unchanged

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete test purchase with real Stripe checkout
- [ ] Verify payment success page loads correctly
- [ ] Check console logs for cache invalidation messages
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard after successful payment
- [ ] Confirm dashboard shows enrolled state (no offer card)
- [ ] Verify course appears in enrolled courses list
- [ ] Test with multiple users to ensure consistency
- [ ] Check React Query DevTools to confirm cache invalidation

## Performance Impact

**Minimal to None**
- Cache invalidation happens once per successful payment
- No additional API calls (refetch uses existing endpoint)
- No impact on page load times
- Improves user experience by showing correct state immediately

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Consider using Firebase real-time listeners for enrollment changes
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately before API confirms enrollment
3. **Cache Synchronization**: Implement global cache invalidation strategy for all enrollment-related data
4. **Webhook Enhancement**: Ensure Stripe webhook also triggers cache invalidation for long-running sessions
