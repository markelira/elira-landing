# Firebase Functions Deployment Complete ✅

## Deployment Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Project**: elira-landing-ce927
**Region**: europe-west1
**Status**: ✅ Deployed successfully (no changes detected)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Firebase Functions Already Up-to-Date ✅

All functions were **skipped** during deployment because no changes were detected:

```
✔ functions[api(europe-west1)] Skipped (No changes detected)
✔ functions[webhook(europe-west1)] Skipped (No changes detected)
✔ functions[consultationReminder(europe-west1)] Skipped (No changes detected)
... (14 more functions)
```

**What this means**:
- Backend is already running latest code
- No function updates were needed
- Course API and enrollment endpoints are live

### 2. Main API Function Details

**Function Name**: `api`
- **Type**: v2 (Cloud Run)
- **Trigger**: HTTPS
- **Location**: europe-west1
- **Memory**: 256MB
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **URL Pattern**: `https://api-[hash]-ew.a.run.app/api/*`

### 3. Cloud Run Service

The `api` function is deployed as a Cloud Run service, which means:
- ✅ It's accessible via the domain pattern we're using
- ✅ Supports `/api/*` routes (courses, enrollments, etc.)
- ✅ Auto-scales based on traffic
- ✅ Integrated with Firebase Authentication

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (Vercel)
    │
    ├─→ Next.js API Routes (/api/*)
    │   └─→ Some endpoints handled by Next.js
    │
    └─→ Firebase Functions (Cloud Run)
        └─→ https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/*
            ├─→ /api/courses/*          (Course data)
            ├─→ /api/enrollments/*      (Enrollment checks)
            ├─→ /api/progress/*         (User progress)
            └─→ /api/payment/*          (Stripe integration)
```

## Environment Variable Status

### Local (.env)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app
```

### Production (Vercel) - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

Based on console errors, production might have:
```
❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://europe-west1-elira-landing-ce927.cloudfunctions.net/api
```

**Should be**:
```
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Production Environment Variable 🔍

Once Vercel deployment completes (should be done now):

1. Open course player: `https://www.elira.hu/courses/ai-copywriting-course/learn`
2. Check browser console for these logs:
   ```javascript
   🔧 [useCourseQueries] FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL: {
     url: '...',              // ← What URL is being used?
     envVar: '...',           // ← What's the env var value?
     nodeEnv: 'production'
   }
   ```

3. Check Network tab for API requests:
   ```
   Should see:
   ✅ GET https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/courses/... → 200 OK
   ✅ GET https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/enrollments/... → 200 OK

   NOT:
   ❌ GET https://europe-west1-elira-landing-ce927.cloudfunctions.net/api/... → 404
   ```

### 2. Update Environment Variable (If Needed) ⚙️

If logs show wrong URL:

**Action**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/markelira/elira-landing/settings/environment-variables
2. Find: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL`
3. Update to: `https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api`
4. Redeploy from Vercel dashboard

### 3. Validate Full Flow ✅

After env var is correct:

**Test Course Access**:
1. Navigate to course player in production
2. Video should load ✅
3. Enrollment status should show ✅
4. Progress tracking should work ✅
5. No 404 errors in console ✅
6. No CSP violations ✅

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Deprecation Warning

Firebase Functions config API is deprecated:
- `functions.config()` will stop working in March 2026
- Need to migrate to `.env` files
- Current setup still works but should be updated

**Migration Todo** (Not urgent - March 2026):
- Move Stripe config to environment variables
- Move SendGrid config to environment variables
- Update functions to use `process.env` instead of `functions.config()`

### 🎯 Current Status

**Backend**: ✅ Deployed and running
**Frontend**: ✅ Deployed (Vercel)
**CSP Policy**: ✅ Fixed (allows Cloud Run)
**Diagnostic Logs**: ✅ Added
**Env Var**: ⏳ Pending verification in production

---

## Testing Endpoints

You can test the API endpoints directly:

### Get Course (Should Work)
```bash
curl https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/courses/ai-copywriting-course
```

### Check Enrollment (Requires Auth)
```bash
curl https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/enrollments/check/ai-copywriting-course?userId=<USER_ID>
```

If these work, the backend is functioning correctly. Any 404s in production would be due to frontend calling wrong URL.

## Summary

✅ **Firebase Functions**: Deployed and up-to-date
✅ **Cloud Run Service**: Active on correct URL
✅ **Backend Config**: Stripe, SendGrid, Firebase all configured
✅ **API Endpoints**: Available at `https://api-5k33v562ya-ew.a.run.app/api/*`
⏳ **Production Frontend**: Needs env var verification

**Next**: Check production logs to confirm frontend is calling correct backend URL!
