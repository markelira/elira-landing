## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Generate New Firebase Configuration
```bash
# Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
# Select project: elira-67ab7
# Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps
# Create new web app configuration or regenerate existing

# Update .env.local with real values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:156979876603..."
```

### Step 2: Generate New Firebase Admin SDK Key
```bash
# Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
# Click "Generate new private key"
# Save as: ../secure/elira-67ab7-firebase-adminsdk.json
# Delete the old exposed key files
```

### Step 3: Configure Third-Party Services

#### SendGrid (Email Service)
```bash
# Sign up at: https://sendgrid.com
# Generate API key
# Update functions/.env:
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-real-key-here"
```

#### Stripe (Payment Processing)
```bash
# Sign up at: https://stripe.com
# Get test keys from dashboard
# Update both .env.local and functions/.env:
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
```

#### Mux (Video Processing)
```bash
# Sign up at: https://mux.com
# Create new access token
# Update both files with real credentials
```

### Step 4: Set Firebase Functions Configuration
```bash
# After getting real keys, set them in Firebase:
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="SG.real-key-here"
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="sk_test_real-key"
firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_real-key"
firebase functions:config:set mux.token_id="your-token-id"
firebase functions:config:set mux.token_secret="your-token-secret"

# Deploy the configuration:
firebase deploy --only functions
