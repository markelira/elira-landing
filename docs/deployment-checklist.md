   ```

3. **Success Redirect URL**
   - Configure in Stripe Checkout session creation
   - URL format: `https://elira.hu/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&courseId={courseId}&amount={amount}`

### Firestore Security Rules

**Verify these rules are deployed:**

```javascript
// user-enrollments collection
match /user-enrollments/{enrollmentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId ||
     request.auth.token.companyId == resource.data.companyId);

  allow create: if request.auth != null &&
    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
}

// userProgress collection
match /userProgress/{progressId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}

// invoices collection
match /invoices/{invoiceId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if false; // Only server can create
}

// analytics-events collection
match /analytics-events/{eventId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&
    request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
  allow create: if false; // Only server can create
}
```

### Firestore Indexes

**Required composite indexes:**

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "user-enrollments",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "courseId", "order": "ASCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "user-enrollments",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "enrolledAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "course-content",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "isPublished", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Deploy indexes:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build Cloud Functions

```bash
cd /Users/marquese/elira-landing/functions
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> tsc
✓ Compiled successfully
```

**Verify build artifacts:**
```bash
ls -la lib/
# Should see compiled .js files matching src/ structure
```

### Step 2: Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash
# Deploy all functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Or deploy specific function
firebase deploy --only functions:completeStripeEnrollment
```

**Monitor deployment:**
```bash
# Watch deployment progress
firebase deploy --only functions --debug

# Expected duration: 2-5 minutes
# Expected output: "✓ functions: all functions deployed successfully"
```

**Verify deployment:**
```bash
# List deployed functions
firebase functions:list

# Check function exists
firebase functions:list | grep completeStripeEnrollment
```

### Step 3: Deploy Firestore Rules & Indexes

```bash
# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy indexes (may take 5-10 minutes to build)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Monitor index build:**
- Navigate to: Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Indexes
- Wait for status: "Building" → "Enabled"

### Step 4: Build Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/marquese/elira-landing
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (x/x)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**Verify build:**
```bash
ls -la .next/
# Should see compiled production build
```

### Step 5: Deploy Frontend

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Firebase Hosting**
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected duration**: 2-3 minutes

### Step 6: Configure DNS (if needed)

If deploying to new domain or subdomain:

```bash
# Verify DNS records
nslookup elira.hu

# Should point to:
# Vercel: 76.76.21.21 or CNAME to cname.vercel-dns.com
# Firebase: A record to Firebase Hosting IP
```

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Cloud Functions Health Check

```bash
# Test completeStripeEnrollment function
curl -X POST https://europe-west1-{project-id}.cloudfunctions.net/completeStripeEnrollment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"sessionId":"test","courseId":"test"}}'

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (means function is running, auth is working)
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only completeStripeEnrollment --limit 10
```

### 2. Frontend Pages Check

Visit these URLs and verify:

- ✅ `https://elira.hu` - Homepage loads
- ✅ `https://elira.hu/auth` - Shows individual registration only
- ✅ `https://elira.hu/company/dashboard` - Requires auth, redirects to login
- ✅ `https://elira.hu/checkout/success?session_id=test` - Shows error (expected, no valid session)

### 3. Email Deliverability Test

**Send test enrollment email:**

1. Create test Stripe checkout session in test mode
2. Complete payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Verify welcome email received at customer email
4. Check email headers for SPF/DKIM pass

**Check SendGrid dashboard:**
- Navigate to: Activity → Activity Feed
- Verify last email status: "Delivered"
- Check bounce rate: Should be < 2%

### 4. Database Verification

**Check Firestore collections exist:**

```bash
# Via Firebase Console or CLI
firebase firestore:get user-enrollments --limit 1
firebase firestore:get userProgress --limit 1
firebase firestore:get course-content --limit 1
```

**Verify indexes are enabled:**
- Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
- All indexes should show "Enabled" status

### 5. Stripe Integration Test

**Test payment flow:**

1. Navigate to course page: `https://elira.hu/courses/{test-course-id}`
2. Click "Vásárlás" button
3. Complete test payment (use test mode Stripe key)
4. Verify redirect to `/checkout/success`
5. Verify enrollment created in Firestore
6. Verify welcome email received
7. Verify course appears in `/dashboard`

**Test cards:**
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Authentication required: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

### 6. Company Dashboard Test

**Verify company features:**

1. Login as company admin
2. Navigate to `https://elira.hu/company/dashboard`
3. Verify "Elérhető képzések" shows real courses from database
4. Check courses have thumbnails (or fallback gradient)
5. Navigate to employees page - verify data loads
6. Navigate to progress page - verify tracking works

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Welcome Email Not Received

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check Cloud Function logs
firebase functions:log --only completeStripeEnrollment --limit 20

# Check SendGrid activity
# Visit: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
```

**Common causes:**
1. SendGrid API key not configured
2. Sender email not verified
3. Email landed in spam
4. SendGrid account suspended

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key: `firebase functions:config:get sendgrid.api_key`
2. Verify sender in SendGrid dashboard
3. Check spam folder, whitelist sender
4. Check SendGrid account status

### Issue: Enrollment Not Created

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check Firestore for enrollment
firebase firestore:get user-enrollments --where userId==USER_ID

# Check Cloud Function logs
firebase functions:log --only completeStripeEnrollment
```

**Common causes:**
1. Stripe session not found
2. Payment not completed
3. Course ID invalid
4. Firestore permissions issue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify session ID in Stripe dashboard
2. Check payment_status === 'paid'
3. Verify course exists in `course-content` collection
4. Check Firestore security rules

### Issue: Payment Success Page Shows Error

**Diagnosis:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check Network tab for failed requests
3. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors

**Common causes:**
1. Cloud Function not deployed
2. Invalid session ID in URL
3. User not authenticated
4. CORS issue

**Solutions:**
1. Deploy function: `firebase deploy --only functions:completeStripeEnrollment`
2. Verify URL params: session_id, courseId
3. Ensure user logged in before redirect
4. Add CORS headers to Cloud Function

### Issue: Company Dashboard Not Loading Courses

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if courses exist
firebase firestore:get course-content --limit 5

# Check browser console for errors
# Check Network tab for failed Firestore requests
```

**Common causes:**
1. No courses in database
2. Firestore security rules blocking reads
3. isPublished field missing
4. Network error

**Solutions:**
1. Add test course to Firestore
2. Update rules to allow course reads
3. Add isPublished: true to all courses
4. Check network connectivity

### Issue: Duplicate Enrollments Created

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check for duplicates
firebase firestore:query user-enrollments --where userId==USER_ID --where courseId==COURSE_ID
```

**Common causes:**
1. User clicked "purchase" multiple times
2. Webhook fired multiple times
3. Race condition in Cloud Function

**Solutions:**
- Cloud Function already has duplicate check (lines 180-195 in completeEnrollment.ts)
- Verify check is working: review logs
- If duplicates exist, manually delete extras
