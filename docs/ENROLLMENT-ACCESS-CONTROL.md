# Enrollment Access Control - Dashboard Features

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Enforced

---

## 🔐 What is "Active Course Access"?

Active course access means a user has an **active enrollment** in the `enrollments` collection with `status: 'active'`.

### Enrollment Statuses:
- `active` - User has full access to course and dashboard features
- `suspended` - Access temporarily revoked (payment issue, violation, etc.)
- `expired` - Course access period ended
- `cancelled` - User cancelled enrollment

---

## 📊 How Dashboard Access Control Works

### 1. API Level (`/api/users/[userId]/progress`)

**Before Fix:**
- Returned all courses from `userProgress.enrolledCourses` array
- No validation of enrollment status
- Users could see dashboard features even without active access

**After Fix (`app/api/users/[userId]/progress/route.ts:112-154`):**
```typescript
// Fetch active enrollments from enrollments collection
const enrollmentsSnapshot = await db
  .collection('enrollments')
  .where('userId', '==', userId)
  .where('status', '==', 'active')  // ✅ ONLY active enrollments
  .get();

const activeEnrollmentCourseIds = new Set(
  enrollmentsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data().courseId)
);

// Filter enrolled courses to only include those with active enrollments
const activeEnrolledCourses = data?.enrolledCourses?.filter((course: any) =>
  activeEnrollmentCourseIds.has(course.courseId)
) || [];
```

**Result:** API only returns courses where user has `status: 'active'` in `enrollments` collection.

---

### 2. Dashboard Level (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Before Fix:**
- Showed stats cards (0/0/0) to all users
- Confusing UX for non-enrolled users

**After Fix (`app/dashboard/page.tsx:131-197`):**
```typescript
// Check if user has any active enrollments
const hasEnrollments = progressData?.enrolledCourses && progressData.enrolledCourses.length > 0;

// Hide stats cards for users without active enrollments
{hasEnrollments && (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
    {/* Stats cards */}
  </div>
)}

// Hide Phase 2 & 3 features for users without active enrollments
{hasEnrollments && (
  <>
    <JourneyTimeline />
    <ConsultationCard />
    <TemplateLibrary />
    <ResultsTracker />
    <AchievementsCard />
  </>
)}
```

**Result:** Dashboard only shows enrolled-user features when `hasEnrollments` is true.

## ✅ What Non-Enrolled Users See

Users **without active course access** see:
- ✅ Welcome header with personalized message
- ✅ Available courses catalog (3 courses)
- ✅ Featured masterclass offer card
- ✅ Quick action buttons (Learning Center, Payment History)

---

## 🎓 What Enrolled Users See

Users **with active course access** (`status: 'active'` in `enrollments`) see everything above PLUS:

### Stats Cards:
- ✅ Total masterclass enrollments
- ✅ Completed programs count
- ✅ Total learning time

### Phase 2 Engagement Features:
- ✅ **JourneyTimeline** - 30-day program progress tracker
- ✅ **ConsultationCard** - Upcoming consultations with prep tasks
- ✅ **TemplateLibrary** - Marketing template downloads

### Phase 3 Premium Features:
- ✅ **ResultsTracker** - Implementation deliverables tracking
- ✅ **AchievementsCard** - Gamification badges and progress

## 🔍 Enrollment Validation Flow

```
User Logs In
    ↓
Dashboard Loads
    ↓
Calls: GET /api/users/[userId]/progress
    ↓
API Queries: enrollments collection
    WHERE userId == [userId]
    WHERE status == 'active'
    ↓
API Filters: userProgress.enrolledCourses
    ONLY courses with active enrollment
    ↓
Returns: { enrolledCourses: [...active only] }
    ↓
Dashboard Checks: hasEnrollments = enrolledCourses.length > 0
    ↓
IF hasEnrollments == true:
    ✅ Show all dashboard features
ELSE:
    ❌ Show only course catalog and purchase options
```

---

## 📝 Enrollment Status Management

### How Enrollments Get Created:

**1. Free Courses:**
```typescript
// functions/src/routes/enrollments.ts:58-75
if (!courseData?.isFree && courseData?.price > 0) {
  // Check payment for paid courses
} else {
  // Create enrollment immediately for free courses
  status: 'active'
}
```

**2. Paid Courses:**
```typescript
// Require completed payment first
const paymentQuery = await db.collection('payments')
  .where('userId', '==', userId)
  .where('courseId', '==', courseId)
  .where('status', '==', 'completed')
  .limit(1)
  .get();

if (paymentQuery.empty) {
  return 402 Payment Required
}

// Then create enrollment
status: 'active'
```

---

### How Enrollments Get Suspended/Cancelled:

**Admin Actions:**
- Manual status change in Firestore
- Via admin panel (future feature)
- Payment chargeback/refund handling

**Automatic Actions:**
- Payment failure on subscription renewal
- Course access period expiration
- Terms of service violation

## 🧪 Testing Access Control

### Test 1: User with No Enrollments
```bash
# Expected: Only sees course catalog, no dashboard features
1. Log in as new user
2. Navigate to /dashboard
3. Verify: No stats cards visible
4. Verify: No JourneyTimeline, ConsultationCard, etc.
5. Verify: See "Fedezze fel szakértői masterclass programjainkat..."
```

### Test 2: User with Active Enrollment
```bash
# Expected: Sees full dashboard with all features
1. Log in as enrolled user
2. Navigate to /dashboard
3. Verify: Stats cards visible with real data
4. Verify: All Phase 2 & 3 features visible
5. Verify: See "Itt követheti nyomon a tanulási előrehaladását..."
```

### Test 3: User with Suspended Enrollment
```bash
# Expected: Same as no enrollments (suspended != active)
1. Set enrollment status = 'suspended' in Firestore
2. Refresh /dashboard
3. Verify: All enrolled features hidden
4. Verify: Only course catalog visible
```
