# ðŸš€ Course Creation Migration - Claude Code Implementation Prompts

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Strategy Overview

Based on the comprehensive analysis, we have a **production-ready course creation system** that can save 3-4 weeks of development. Here are the detailed prompts for Claude Code to execute this migration:

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Environment Setup & Dependencies (Prompt 1)

### **Prompt for Claude Code:**
```
Install the required dependencies for the course creation system migration. The analysis shows we need these specific packages:

1. Install Mux video processing packages:
   - @mux/mux-node@^12.3.0 (for backend video processing)
   - @mux/mux-player-react@^3.5.1 (for video playback)

2. Install PDF handling packages:
   - react-pdf@^10.0.1 (for PDF viewer component)
   - pdfjs-dist@^5.4.54 (PDF.js core library)

3. Install rich text editor packages:
   - react-quill@^2.0.0 (Quill-based rich text editor)
   - quill-resize-image@^1.0.11 (image resize plugin)

4. Install state management (if not already present):
   - zustand (for course wizard state management)

5. Create the following directory structure:
   - src/components/course-creation/
   - src/components/lesson/
   - src/stores/
   - src/types/course/

After installation, verify all packages are properly installed and check for any peer dependency warnings that need to be resolved.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Core Store Migration (Prompt 2)

### **Prompt for Claude Code:**
```
Create a comprehensive course wizard store using Zustand with persistence. Based on the analysis, this store needs to handle:

1. Create `/src/stores/courseWizardStore.ts` with the following features:
   - Multi-step wizard state (3 steps: BasicInfo â†’ Curriculum â†’ Publishing)
   - Course data management with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Module and lesson management (add, update, delete)
   - Form validation for each step
   - LocalStorage persistence to prevent data loss
   - Loading states for async operations

2. Define these TypeScript interfaces:
   - CourseData (with all required fields from the analysis)
   - Module (with lessons array)
   - Lesson (supporting VIDEO, PDF, TEXT, QUIZ types)
   - Step validation logic

3. Implement these store methods:
   - setStep() - navigate between wizard steps
   - updateCourseData() - update course basic info
   - addModule(), updateModule(), deleteModule() - module management
   - addLesson(), updateLesson(), deleteLesson() - lesson management
   - isStepValid() - validation for each step
   - reset() - clear all data

4. Add persistence configuration to save progress to localStorage with the key 'course-wizard-store'

The store should handle Hungarian UI language but keep code in English.
```
