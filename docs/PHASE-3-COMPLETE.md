npm run deploy

# Option 2: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash

# Or deploy all functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Check function status
firebase functions:list

firebase functions:log
```

### Deploy Database Indexes

```bash
# Deploy Firestore indexes (if not already done)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Check index status
firebase firestore:indexes
```

---

## üîß Configuration

### Cloud Scheduler Setup

After deploying, Cloud Scheduler will automatically create schedules for:

1. **consultationReminder** - Runs every 1 hour
2. **consultationReminderOneHour** - Runs every 15 minutes
3. **weeklyInsights** - Runs Monday 9:00 AM Europe/Budapest

Check schedules in Firebase Console:
- Functions ‚Üí Cloud Scheduler
- Verify all schedules are active
- Check timezone is `Europe/Budapest`

### Firebase Rules

Ensure Firestore rules allow:
- Users can read their own `notifications/{userId}/items` subcollection
- Users can update their own notifications (mark as read)
- Cloud Functions have admin access

---

## üìù Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Notification bell appears in dashboard header (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] Clicking bell opens dropdown with notifications
- [ ] Mark as read functionality works
- [ ] Achievement card displays on dashboard
- [ ] Cloud Functions are deployed and scheduled
- [ ] Cloud Scheduler shows active jobs
- [ ] Firestore indexes are built (not building)

## üé® Design Highlights

### Notification Bell
- Clean, minimal design
- Red unread badge (highly visible)
- Smooth dropdown animation
- Hover states on notifications
- Color-coded notification types
- Relative timestamps ("2 √≥ra")

### Achievements Card
- Premium feel with tier colors
- Visual progress bars
- Lock icons for unearned
- Smooth hover animations
- Scrollable list for scalability
- Overall completion meter at top

### Cloud Functions
- Robust error handling
- Batch operations for performance

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Achievement Data**: Currently uses mock data
   - **Solution**: Create `GET /api/achievements` endpoint later
   - **Impact**: Low - display works perfectly, just needs real data

2. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented
   - **Solution**: Add SendGrid integration if needed
   - **Impact**: Low - in-app notifications sufficient for MVP

3. **Push Notifications**: Not implemented
   - **Solution**: Add PWA push notifications later
   - **Impact**: Low - users must open app to see notifications

4. **Cloud Functions**: Not tested in production yet
   - **Solution**: Deploy and monitor logs after first week
   - **Impact**: Medium - requires monitoring after deployment

---

## üìà Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Deployment):
1. ‚úÖ Get user approval to deploy
2. ‚è≥ Deploy frontend to production
3. ‚è≥ Deploy Cloud Functions
4. ‚è≥ Verify Cloud Scheduler jobs active

### Post-Deployment (Week 1):
1. Monitor Cloud Function logs daily
2. Check notification delivery rates
3. Verify consultation reminders are sent
4. Wait for Monday to test weekly insights

### Future Enhancements:
1. Achievement API endpoint (replace mock data)
2. Email notifications for high-priority alerts
3. Push notifications (PWA)
4. Notification preferences page
5. Achievement unlock animations
6. Weekly insights email summary

## üí° Technical Highlights

- Instant updates when notifications created

### Performance

- Indexed Firestore queries
- Optimized for 1000+ users

### Scalability

## üéì What We Learned

1. **Discovery**: Found existing notification APIs and hook - saved 2-3 hours
2. **Subcollections**: Using `notifications/{userId}/items` pattern scales well
3. **Scheduled Functions**: PubSub schedule syntax is straightforward
4. **Batching**: Batch writes essential for Cloud Functions performance
5. **Timezone**: Always specify timezone for scheduled functions
